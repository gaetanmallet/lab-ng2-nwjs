# lab-ng2-nwjs

In this project I'll try to create a simple Hello World App with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) and [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) running in [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and latter evolve it to a multiroute form app. 

I came from a C/C++ and Java background, so I'm trying this as a personal challenge since I'm new to modern Ecmascript tools and libraries.

I grew very interested in NW.js (former Node-WebKit) and Angular as a solution to develop full blown desktop apps without the complexity of Java installation and visual API's like Swing and JavaFX. I personally consider JFX styling quite awkward.

I choose to base my buid tools around [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) after some tests against [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

## Steps

1. Try node-webkit-builder. Installing globally.

## Roadmap

1. Create a basic NW.js, TypeScript and Gulp build.
